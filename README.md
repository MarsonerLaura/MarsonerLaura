## About Me

I am a recent Games Engineering graduate with a passion for developing games. I have been programming since 8 years and have experience in programming languages such as Java, C#, and  C++ as well as a strong understanding of the Unity engine. I am eager to apply my skills to create engaging and immersive gameplay experiences.

Throughout my studies, I gained a foundation in game development, including the design and implementation of gameplay systems such as AI, physics, UI, and audio. I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field, and I am constantly seeking new challenges to expand my skill set.

I am particularly proud of my project Kingdom of Math, where I completed the entire development process from game design to programming the gameplay systems. I also conducted a user study to evaluate the game experience and make improvements based on user feedback. This project showcases my ability to work independently, solve programming problems, and deliver a game that is both engaging and educational.

In my portfolio, you can find examples of my work, including code snippets and project write-ups. Thank you for considering my portfolio, and I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with you and your team to create great games!
